Title: Security configuration
---
Here's how to set up security and privacy.

## Data encryption

Keep your website up to date. It's recommended to update the website as soon as a new release is available. Also check if your website supports data encryption. It's best if the Internet connection is always encrypted with HTTPS. When there are problems, please contact your web hosting provider.

## User restriction

If you don't want that pages are modified, then restrict user accounts. Users are allowed to edit pages within their home page, but nowhere else. If you don't want that user accounts are created, then restrict the login page. Users are allowed to reset their password, but cannot create a new user account.
