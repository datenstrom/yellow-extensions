## How to edit a website

The login page is available on your website as `http://website/edit/`. Log in with your user account. You can browse your website, make some changes and see the result immediately. It's a great way to update your website. To show an edit link add an `[edit]` shortcut to a page. See example below.

## How to create a user account

The first option is to create a user account in a web browser. Go to the login page. You can create a user account and change your password. The webmaster needs to approve new user accounts. The webmaster's email is defined in file `system/settings/system.ini`.

The second option is to create a user account at the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-extensions/tree/master/features/command). Open a terminal window. Go to your installation folder, where the `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php user add` followed by email, password and an optional name. All user accounts are stored in file `system/settings/user.ini`. See example below.

## How to configure a website

The following settings can be configured in file `system/settings/system.ini`:

`Author` = name of the webmaster  
`Email` = email of the webmaster  
`SafeMode` = enable [safe mode](https://developers.datenstrom.se/help/security-configuration#safe-mode) with restrictions, 1 or 0
