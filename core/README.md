## How to use the core

The plugin provides the core functionality for your website. It takes care of requests from the web browser and access to the file system. You can use the [web browser](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/edit) or the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/command) to show software version and updates. To show more information about your website add a `[yellow]` shortcut to a page. See example below.

## How to configure the core

The following settings can be configured in file `system/config/config.ini`:

`Sitename` = name of the website  
`Author` = webmaster's name  
`Email` = webmaster's email  
`Language` = default language  
`Timezone` = default timezone  
`Theme` = default theme  

These are the most important settings. For a complete list see [configuration file](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/blob/master/system/config/config.ini).
