## How to edit a website?

## How to create a user account?

The first option is to create a user account in a web browser. Click the edit link on a page. You can create a user account and change your password. The webmaster needs to approve new user accounts. The webmaster's email is defined in file `system/config/config.ini`, for example `Email: email@example.com`.

The second option is to create a user account at the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/commandline). Open a terminal window. Go to your Yellow installation, where the `yellow.php` is. Type `php yellow.php user` followed by email and password. You can add optional name and language. All user accounts are stored in file `system/config/user.ini`. See example below.
